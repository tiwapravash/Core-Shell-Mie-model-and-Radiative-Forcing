As we employ MIE model to constraint the TROPOMI SSA and use this inc ombination with AERONET to compute the BCsize mixing state proxy, total aerosol number column(Ncol) and BCmass.
The resultant output data becomes highly irregular with point data at each lat/lon since the product initially extracted TROPOMAER SSA/AOD/AAOD (V1.1) are at 7*3.5km resolution we use 
the closest possible resolution to regrid this with minor inaccuracies of 
The code reads input data containing longitude, latitude, BCmass, and Ncol columns, divides the domain into a regularly spaced grid, and estimates the corresponding BCmass and Ncol 
values for each grid cell based on surrounding data. 
The main steps include:
1.Reading input data
2.Defining grid boundaries and step sizes
3.Creating a fine grid covering the whole domain
4.Looping through dates and processing per-day data
4a. Calculating distances between each measurement and grid cells
4b. Computing the weights based on the ratio of product of distances to grid step sizes
4c. Estimating BCmass, Ncol, and weights for each grid cell
4d. Visualizing estimation results
4e. Saving intermediate results

Concepts related to IDW:
Weight calculations consider the proximity of measurements to grid cells.
Measurements closer to grid cells receive higher weights, reflecting IDW's principle of increased importance assigned to nearby samples.

Concepts related to Shepard's technique:
Weights decrease smoothly as measurements move away from grid cells, aligning with the idea of reduced influence exhibited by Shepard's method.
Sudden transitions in influencing factors found in traditional IDW methods are avoided, allowing for a continuous representation reminiscent of Shepard's technique.

Mass conservation occurs locally within each grid box. Since the custom distance-based weighting method allocates exact fractions of the total mass contributed by each measurement to adjacent grid cells,
no loss or gain of mass happens during the computation process. Additionally, since every measurement participates only once in the weight calculation, the mass remains balanced throughout the procedure.
